Open Bounty Tasks
==================
- ``$500`` pip package for malmo 


  The task is to build a ``pip`` package for malmo to ensure that anyone can install malmo across all platforms with just 
  ``pip3 install malmo``
  
  In terms of python versions, we would ideally want to support just pyhton36 and python37, and platform specific dependencies are supposed to be installed separately.
  Making a conda package available would be an added plus.
  If you wish to claim this bounty task, please send an email to : ``sharada.mohanty@epfl.ch`` with ``nkuno@microsoft.com`` in cc.
  The payment will be processed as soon as a working ``pip`` package is delivered,  and the author will be expected to be available to help answer installation specific questions for 6 months from the date of delivery of the package.
